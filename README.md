# Markdown Document Builder ( mdb.py )

A python library for building markdown documents, is it a good idea to do it like this, probably not. but this was created because I wanted to play around with python OOP and inheritance.

The aim is to provide a simple library which can be used to build up  a markdown document in code, without having to write giant strings yourself.

see `example.py` for an example of using the library to build this document.

## TODO

  - Implement builder pattern 

  - Add better type safety 

  - Unit Tests
